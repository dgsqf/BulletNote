# BulletNote
 A text format for easy note writing.


# Design

Bullet's design is centered on 3 core constraints

1. Notes should be legible without any additional software
2. Notes should be easily writable with little added syntax
3. Note translation to other formats should be customizable with themes

# Other features

### Abbreviation translation

You can add custom abbreviations to write faster
